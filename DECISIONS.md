# DECISIONS.md

Architectural decision records. Append only. If a decision is reversed, add a
new ADR that supersedes the old one — do not edit history.

Format: Context → Decision → Consequences.

---

## ADR-001 — Local `converse` model
**Status:** pending Phase 0

Chosen by benchmark, not reputation. See `bench/bench_local.py`.

---

## ADR-002 — `reason` provider
**Status:** accepted (provisional)

**Context.** Heavy reasoning needs a model larger than this machine can host.
**Decision.** NVIDIA Build (NIM) free tier, OpenAI-compatible, ~40 RPM.
**Consequences.**
- Free, no card, no expiry, 80+ open models including DeepSeek / Qwen / GLM.
- Adds 80–150 ms network latency from Europe. Acceptable: this lane is async.
- NVIDIA's terms restrict the free tier to development, testing, research and
  evaluation — personal use qualifies; serving end users or business
  transactions does not. **This system must never be wired into a customer-
  facing product on this tier.**
- Free-tier terms change. Mitigated by ADR-008.
- No paid provider is built or configured anywhere in the system. See ADR-009.

## ADR-003 — STT: whisper.cpp
**Status:** accepted

**Decision.** whisper.cpp with Metal, `large-v3-turbo`, `language=en`.
**Consequences.** Offline, free, permanent. Better on Apple Silicon than
CTranslate2-based alternatives. English-only operation raises accuracy
materially versus Portuguese.

## ADR-004 — TTS: `say` then Piper
**Status:** accepted

**Decision.** macOS `say` in Phase 1; Piper from Phase 2.
**Consequences.** `say` has near-zero latency and zero setup — right for proving
the loop. Piper sounds better. Piper is GPL-3.0 since the MIT repo was archived
in Oct 2025; fine for personal use, relevant only if ever distributed.

---

## ADR-005 — Wake word: openWakeWord
**Status:** accepted

**Decision.** openWakeWord with the pretrained `hey_jarvis` model.
**Consequences.** Zero training required. Its Speex noise suppression is
Linux-only, so macOS gets none — budget half a day for threshold tuning.
`livekit-wakeword` exports openWakeWord-compatible ONNX and reports better
metrics; it is the drop-in upgrade if tuning fails.

---

## ADR-006 — Code harness: Aider
**Status:** accepted

**Context.** The `act` lane needs an agent loop. Writing one is a project.
**Decision.** Aider, pointed at the router's `reason` provider.
**Consequences.** Git is the trust boundary: every change is a commit, every
commit is revertible and diffable. This *is* the HITL mechanism for code — it
removes an entire subsystem from the build. Alternatives if Aider disappoints:
Goose, OpenHands, Cline. All are model-agnostic and take any OpenAI-compatible
endpoint.

---

## ADR-007 — Store: SQLite
**Status:** accepted

**Decision.** SQLite with `sqlite-vec`. Not Postgres.
**Consequences.** Zero infrastructure, zero daemon, trivial backup (copy a
file). Single-writer is not a constraint here — only `core` writes. Revisit only
if concurrent writers appear.

---

## ADR-008 — No single provider dependency
**Status:** accepted

**Context.** Free tiers change without notice. Published limits for NVIDIA's
free tier already contradict each other across sources because they shifted
during 2026.
**Decision.** Every lane has an ordered provider list with at least one
`free-local` fallback. Adding a provider is one file plus one config line.
**Consequences.** Slightly more work up front. The system survives any single
provider changing its terms, and a paid provider becomes a config change rather
than a migration.

---

## ADR-009 — Paid providers deferred
**Status:** accepted · supersedes the provisional stub in v0.1

**Context.** The owner initially planned to buy a Claude Pro/Max subscription to
obtain an API key. That is not how those products work, and the current priority
is a system that works completely on free infrastructure.

**Decision.** No paid provider is built, stubbed or configured. The
`ModelProvider` interface exists and is sufficient; adding a paid adapter later
is one file plus one config line, per ADR-008. Nothing in any phase's Definition
of Done may require a paid key.

**Facts to preserve for when this is revisited:**
- A Claude Pro/Max subscription does **not** include API or Console access.
  Anthropic's help centre is explicit: a paid subscription enhances the chat
  experience but does not include the API or Console. Programmatic access
  requires Claude Console with separately purchased prepaid credits.
- Pro/Max *does* cover interactive Claude Code for the owner's own work. That is
  a different thing from this system calling an API, and it is not blocked by
  this ADR.
- **Trap:** if `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set in the environment, Claude Code uses
  API billing instead of the subscription. If a key is ever added here, it lives
  in an isolated shell scope loaded only by the Jarvis launchd job — never in
  `~/.zshrc`, never exported globally.

**Consequences.** One less moving part. The system is provably free-tier-only,
which is also the cleanest position under NVIDIA's development-use terms.

## ADR-010 — The camera is a voice-controlled session
**Status:** accepted · refines v0.1

**Context.** The owner's requirement: say "turn on the camera", state what is
needed, get an answer, and have it shut down. Not ambient. Not always on.

**Decision.** The camera is a session with an explicit state machine:
`IDLE → ARMED → CAPTURE → ARMED → IDLE`, specified in `SPEC.md` § 6.

Invariants that are not negotiable:
- **ARMED is not recording.** Arming the camera captures nothing. A frame is
  taken only when a request is made. This is the difference between a tool and
  a surveillance device.
- Every follow-up request **re-captures**; frames are never reused. The owner
  has usually moved something, which is the whole point in the workbench case.
- The indicator is on for the entire ARMED session, not only during capture.
- Two announced timeouts: 120 s idle, 10 min absolute. Configurable, not
  removable.
- Frames are deleted on close unless an approved `observation` references them.
- "Close the camera" is a `reflex`-lane command and pre-empts anything in flight.

**Consequences.** Continuous local VLM inference was never viable on a laptop,
so this costs nothing technically. It also produces a better product: an
assistant that comments unprompted becomes tiring rather than useful, and one
whose camera state is always unambiguous is one you can leave running.

## ADR-011 — The owner is the source of truth for quantities
**Status:** accepted · supersedes the estimate-range design in v0.1

**Context.** v0.1 proposed storing vision-derived calorie estimates as ranges
with confidence. The owner proposed something better: he states the food and
the quantity himself and confirms everything before it is written.

**Decision.** No model ever produces a number that is stored as fact.

| Who | Does |
|---|---|
| Vision | Identifies. "Looks like grilled chicken, white rice, green salad." |
| Owner | Quantifies and confirms. "180g chicken, 150g rice, 80g salad." |
| Lookup table | Converts. Confirmed food + confirmed grams → calories, macros. |
| Model | Never touches the number. |

Nothing is written until the owner has heard it read back and agreed. An item
with no declared quantity is logged without one; it is never estimated.

Nutrition data comes from local static datasets — Open Food Facts (open data,
good European and Portuguese barcode coverage) and USDA FoodData Central (public
domain, strong on raw and generic foods). Downloaded once, queried offline. A
lookup miss is reported to the owner, not filled in by a model.

**Consequences.**
- The hardest correctness problem in the original design disappears entirely.
  Vision does the thing it is reliable at (identification) and nothing else.
- Daily totals become legitimate, because every number is declared or measured.
  The v0.1 prohibition on totalling applied to estimates; there are no longer
  any estimates in this path.
- The `Estimate` type remains in `shared/types.ts` for genuinely uncertain
  things — a vision identification's confidence, a coach's inferred pattern —
  and still has no `value` field.
- The same contract governs `workbench`: confirm the component, then advise.
  "I think that's a 220 ohm, confirm?" before "your LED will draw about 15 mA",
  never after.

## ADR-012 — Skills come before the dashboard
**Status:** accepted

**Context.** The owner's stated goal is a system of skills, well structured. In
v0.1 the skill host was Phase 7, after the gate and the dashboard.

**Decision.** The skill host moves to Phase 5, before both. Its first skill,
`brief`, needs only `MEMORY_READ`, so it requires no gate and proves the
interface at zero risk.

**Consequences.** The interface that everything else plugs into gets exercised
by real use before the gate and the UI are built around it, so their designs are
informed rather than speculative. The phase's acceptance criterion is a
stopwatch: `make new-skill` to a working no-op skill in under 30 minutes. That
number, more than any other in this project, predicts whether it has ten skills
in a year or three.

---

## ADR-013 — `ctx.ask` is a platform primitive
**Status:** accepted

**Context.** Every skill worth having is conversational: identify, ask, confirm,
correct, write. If each skill implements its own question-and-wait loop, they
will all differ and all be subtly broken.

**Decision.** `ctx.ask(question, opts)` — speak a question, await a spoken
answer, with timeout — is provided by the skill host, not by skills.

**Consequences.** The confirmation loop in `docs/SKILLS.md` § 5 becomes the
default shape of a skill. Interruption, timeout and cancellation are handled
once, correctly, in one place.
