# BACKLOG.md

Ideas go here. They do not go into the build.

The agent is instructed to append here whenever it notices something worth
doing that is not in the current phase. You add to it during SOAK periods.

Nothing leaves this file without becoming a numbered phase in `ROADMAP.md`.

## Skills

- `wardrobe` — outfit opinions from a photo
- `workbench` — Arduino / assembly step tracking with confirmation prompts
- Calendar and email triage
- LeadHunter / HoqueiManager read-only widgets

## Platform
- `make types` codegen from `shared/types.ts` (its own docstring already
  names this for the Python side, never built). Phase 7 added a second
  hand-kept mirror (`ui/src/lib/types.ts`, the wire subset `ServerEvent`/
  `ClientEvent`/`ApprovalRequest`/etc. need, since `ui/` is a separate
  Next.js project and can't just import `core`'s `.ts` files across the
  process boundary) — now two manual mirrors to keep in sync by hand
  instead of one. Worth it once a drift bug actually happens, not before.
- Bounded continuous-vision sessions ("watch me solder this")
- Mobile client for approvals away from the desk
- Sandboxed `act` lane (OpenHands-style container)
- Additional providers: Groq, Gemini, OpenRouter, Cerebras
- `livekit-wakeword` if openWakeWord tuning proves unreliable
- Piper voice cloning for a custom JARVIS voice
- Smart glasses (camera-equipped) as a future JARVIS embodiment — owner is
  considering buying a pair. Long-term only: after the desktop + camera-session
  flow (Phase 8) is fully working and lived with. Would need its own capture/
  display constraints revisited against `SPEC.md` § 6 (the camera-session
  model), not assumed to carry over as-is. Not scheduled, not designed.
- Persistent menu-bar indicator for camera/listening/wake state (`rumps` or
  raw `pyobjc` `NSStatusItem`). Phase 2's "visible acknowledgement on wake"
  used a transient macOS notification instead — real scope (a whole small
  menu-bar app) that nothing currently requires. Worth it once there's more
  than one thing to show ambient state for (listening, camera armed,
  approval pending) — natural fit once Phase 7's dashboard exists, maybe
  earlier if a transient notification proves annoying in daily use.
