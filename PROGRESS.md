## Current state

**Phase:** 1 — Voice loop, push-to-talk
**Status:** in progress — code complete and `make check` green, but the DoD's
two measured checks (20-sentence word accuracy, 10-trial latency) need
Pedro's actual voice, and the hotkey needs a one-time macOS permission grant
neither of which I can do myself. See "Open questions for the owner" below.
**Branch:** `phase/01-voice-loop`
**Last updated:** 2026-08-03

## Repository scaffold — 2026-08-03

Not a phase — done ahead of Phase 0 so the documented architecture in
`SPEC.md` § 10 exists on disk before any code is written against it.

- Git repo initialized (`main`), all planning docs committed as the baseline.
- Directory skeleton created matching `SPEC.md` § 10: `senses/{ears,eyes,voice}`,
  `core/{router,memory,gate,skills}`, `skills/`, `data/{food,frames}`, `ui/`,
  `bench/`, `shared/`, `docs/`. Empty dirs hold `.gitkeep`.
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` added: Mermaid graphs (process graph, router lanes,
  request lifecycle, memory ER, camera FSM, gate FSM, module import
  boundaries, phase DAG) plus a concept → file → spec-section lookup table.
  Derived from `SPEC.md`; treat any drift between them as a bug.
- `core/persona.md` baseline written (SKILLS.md § 6 expects it to exist).
- TypeScript tooling: root `package.json` + strict `tsconfig.json`
  (`noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` on). `shared/types.ts`
  typechecks clean — verified with `npx tsc --noEmit`.
- Python: `pyproject.toml` with a `ruff` config, targeting py311.
- `Makefile` with `check` (tsc + ruff) and `bench` (runs `nim_smoke.sh`).
  Only real targets — `new-skill`, `dev`, `types` are added when the phase
  that needs them (5, 1/3, 5) is actually built, not stubbed now.
- `.env.example`, `.nvmrc` (pinned to Node 22, matching installed `v22.22.2`).
- Original browser-exported `jarvis-phase0.tar.gz` moved to `.archive/`
  (gitignored) — its contents were verified byte-identical to the files now
  in their proper locations before the move.

**Found while setting up, not yet acted on:**
- System `python3` is 3.9.6 (Apple's system Python), past upstream EOL
  (3.9 support ended Oct 2025). Fine for nothing right now — `bench_local.py`
  and `nim_smoke.sh` are stdlib/bash only — but `senses/` in Phase 1 will want
  a modern interpreter. Recommend installing 3.11+ (pyenv or Homebrew) before
  Phase 1 starts.
- `ruff` is not installed, so `make check` currently fails on the Python half
  with a clear "ruff: No such file or directory" — install it
  (`brew install ruff`) before relying on `make check`.
- `aider` is not installed — expected, it is not needed until Phase 12.

## Hardware

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Machine | MacBook Air (M1), Model Identifier MacBookAir10,1 |
| Chip | Apple M1 — 8 cores (4 performance + 4 efficiency) |
| Unified memory | **8 GB** |
| macOS | 15.6.1 (Sequoia, build 24G90) |

**8 GB is below the 16 GB floor `README.md`'s model-tier table assumes.**
Substituted the suggested `qwen3:8b` + `phi4` pair with what fits this
machine in practice: benchmarked `gemma3:4b` (sized for 8 GB) alongside
`qwen3:8b` (already pulled locally from prior use, kept in the run for real
data on whether it's usable despite the RAM pressure — see Phase 0 log for
the numbers). Serial number / hardware UUID intentionally not recorded here
— not needed for model selection, and this file is version-controlled.

## Phase log

### Phase 0 — complete, 2026-08-03

**Built:**
- Hardware profile recorded (see § Hardware).
- NIM key stored in Keychain (`jarvis-nim-key`); `bench/nim_smoke.sh` run
  live: 7/7 passed.
- Fixed a real bug in `bench/bench_local.py`: `except (urllib.error.URLError,
  TimeoutError)` doesn't catch `socket.timeout` on Python 3.9 (it only became
  a `TimeoutError` alias in 3.10) — crashed mid-benchmark. Now `except
  OSError`, which covers all three uniformly and is simpler.
- `bench/bench_nim_lane.py` written: same 45-case set as `bench_local.py`
  (imported, not duplicated), targets NIM instead of Ollama, paced at 30 rpm.
- Local: `gemma3:4b` and `qwen3:8b` both tested via Ollama, both unusable on
  this hardware (timeouts / OOM-restart thrashing — see ADR-001 for the raw
  evidence).
- NIM: `meta/llama-3.2-3b-instruct` unusable (degenerate JSON-mode output),
  `meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct` usable (100% valid JSON, 709ms median / 1019ms
  p95, 71.1% lane accuracy).

**Decided:**
- ADR-001: `converse`/lane-classification routes to NIM
  (`meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct`), not local — no local candidate survived
  contact with this machine's 8 GB of RAM.
- ADR-002: confirmed accepted (was provisional) — NIM smoke-tested live,
  `meta/llama-3.3-70b-instruct` for `reason`.

**Left over:**
- 71.1% lane accuracy is below the 85% bar. Failures are concentrated in one
  fixable gap (camera on/off phrases aren't taught as `reflex` examples in
  the benchmark's system prompt) plus genuinely ambiguous short utterances —
  see ADR-001's failure analysis. Phase 3 should add those examples and
  re-check before assuming the number is final.
- A sub-2B local model (`qwen3:1.7b`, `llama3.2:1b`) was never tried. Worth a
  cheap look during SOAK 1.
- `ruff` still not installed locally (flagged at scaffold time, still true).

**Surprised me:**
- The 8 GB RAM ceiling. The project's own docs assumed 16 GB as the floor;
  nobody had checked this specific machine against that assumption before
  now. Local Ollama inference didn't just run slowly, it was unstable
  (OOM-restart loops) — worth remembering as a reason to distrust "should be
  fine" sizing assumptions in general on this hardware.
- How much better `meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct` did than the 3B model —
  perfect JSON vs. degenerate repetition loops. Model-size cliffs on
  instruction-following-under-constrained-decoding are real and not
  smoothly predictable from parameter count alone.

### Phase 1 — in progress, 2026-08-03

**Built:**
- `.venv` on Homebrew Python 3.13 (not system 3.9.6 — see Phase 0's note).
  `requirements.txt`: `sounddevice`, `pynput`, `numpy`, `pytest`.
- `senses/ipc.py`: shared newline-JSON-over-`AF_UNIX` transport for
  `ears`/`voice`/the bridge. See ADR-014.
- `senses/ears/`: `config.py`, `audio_capture.py` (mic → WAV, `sounddevice`),
  `hotkey.py` (hold-to-talk via `pynput`, right Option), `transcribe.py`
  (shells out to `whisper-cli` with native `--vad`), `main.py`, `fakes.py`,
  `tests/test_ears.py`.
- `senses/voice/`: `config.py`, `say_backend.py` (`say` subprocess),
  `sentences.py` (splits for streaming), `main.py`, `fakes.py`,
  `tests/test_voice.py`.
- `senses/echo_bridge.py`: the Phase-1-only stand-in for `core/`, plus the
  latency log the 10-trial DoD reads.
- `bench/score_phase1.py`: interactive 20-sentence word-accuracy scorer
  (proper word-level edit distance / WER, not a fuzzy match) — the tool
  Pedro runs for that half of the DoD.
- `data/models/whisper/`: `ggml-large-v3-turbo-q5_0.bin` (574MB),
  `ggml-silero-v5.1.2.bin` (865KB) — gitignored, fetched from
  `ggerganov/whisper.cpp` and `ggml-org/whisper-vad` on HF.
- `Makefile`: `check` now runs ruff over `senses/` too plus `pytest`; new
  `dev` target starts all three processes together (`PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1` —
  see "Surprised me").
- Verified end-to-end wiring myself (`make dev`, watched the log): voice
  listens → bridge connects to ears → ears listens → bridge connects to
  voice → both accept. Confirmed `make check` green (tsc + ruff + 8 pytest
  cases, all fakes-based, no mic/model/network per CLAUDE.md § 3).

**Decided:**
- ADR-014: native `whisper-cli --vad` instead of a separate Python Silero
  pipeline (no `torch`/`onnxruntime` in `senses/ears` at all); plain
  newline-JSON Unix sockets for `ears`/`voice`/bridge, `ears`/`voice` as
  servers, the orchestrator (bridge today, `core/` later) as client.

**Left over — needs Pedro, not automatable:**
- Grant Accessibility permission for the hotkey listener (System Settings →
  Privacy & Security → Accessibility). `make dev` currently prints "This
  process is not trusted!" from `pynput` — expected, not a bug. Whichever
  app/binary is actually running the Python process needs the grant; if
  it's not obvious which one from the System Settings picker, add it and
  retry rather than guessing blind.
- Run `make dev`, hold right Option, speak — confirm the round-trip actually
  works with a live mic before trusting the scored numbers below.
- Run `bench/score_phase1.py` for the 20-sentence word-accuracy DoD check
  (needs ≥ 95%).
- 10 timed round-trips via `make dev`, reading `echo_bridge`'s per-utterance
  latency log (needs < 1.5s to first audible syllable). Note: the logged
  number is end-of-speech → handed-to-voice; it excludes `say`'s own process
  spawn (typically well under 50ms) — see `senses/echo_bridge.py`'s
  docstring for exactly what it does and doesn't measure.
- Confirm "works with Wi-Fi off" — I did toggle Wi-Fi off for the synthetic
  whisper-cli smoke test below and it worked (fully local pipeline, no
  network calls in `senses/ears`/`senses/voice`/the bridge), but a real
  press-and-speak trial with Wi-Fi off is still owed.

**Surprised me:**
- **This machine has two Homebrew installs.** `/usr/local` (Intel — a
  leftover, possibly from before this Mac or from following old x86
  instructions) and `/opt/homebrew` (native arm64). PATH puts `/usr/local`
  first, so `brew install whisper-cpp` and `brew install ruff` both silently
  installed **x86_64 binaries running under Rosetta** — confirmed via
  `file` (Mach-O 64-bit executable x86_64) and the complete absence of any
  Metal backend or ARM-specific CPU kernels in the loaded libraries.
  Rosetta whisper.cpp technically works, just slow and contrary to ADR-003's
  explicit "Metal." Fixed by installing the native versions via
  `/opt/homebrew/bin/brew` alongside the existing ones (didn't remove the
  Intel install — something else may depend on it, not my call to delete)
  and pointing `senses/ears/config.py`'s `WHISPER_CLI` at the explicit
  native path rather than trusting PATH resolution. Native `whisper-cli`
  confirmed loading the Metal backend (`GPU name: MTL0 (Apple M1)`). Left
  the global shell PATH alone — reordering it is a call for Pedro, it
  affects more than this project.
- **A synthetic self-test lied to me first.** Generated test audio with
  `say -o file "..."` (no `-v` voice flag) and got badly garbled
  transcriptions — "The Quick Brown Facts Junkz Overdailas IDOG." instead
  of "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog." Spent real effort ruling
  out VAD, quantization, and the Rosetta issue above as the cause before
  finding the actual one: this machine has **no default `say` voice
  configured** (`SelectedVoiceName` doesn't exist in prefs), so unset `-v`
  fell through to some novelty voice (the day's `say -v '?'` listing led
  with "Albert," "Bad News," "Bubbles," "Wobble" — voices designed to sound
  strange). With `-v Samantha` explicitly, transcription was perfect on the
  first try. Fixed `senses/voice/config.py`'s `SAY_VOICE` default to
  `"Samantha"` rather than the system default, since there isn't a sane one
  on this machine to fall back to. Lesson: when a pipeline's own self-test
  looks broken, check the test's *input* generation before the pipeline
  under test — I burned three debugging steps (VAD, quantization thinking,
  the real Rosetta fix) before checking the one thing that was actually
  wrong.
- Output buffering bit twice in one session (bench scripts in Phase 0, now
  `make dev` here) — same root cause, Python block-buffers stdout whenever
  it isn't a TTY. Now fixed at the `Makefile` level with `PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1`
  for `dev`, and worth remembering as a pattern, not a one-off.

## Open questions for the owner

- [ ] Grant Accessibility permission so the push-to-talk hotkey actually
      receives key events (System Settings → Privacy & Security →
      Accessibility). One-time, can't be scripted.
- [ ] Run `make dev`, hold right Option, speak a few things — confirm the
      live round-trip works before trusting anything scored below.
- [ ] Run `.venv/bin/python bench/score_phase1.py` for the 20-sentence word
      accuracy DoD check (needs ≥ 95%).
- [ ] Do 10 timed round-trips via `make dev` and check `echo_bridge`'s
      latency log against the < 1.5s DoD bar.
- [ ] This machine has two Homebrew installs (`/usr/local` Intel/Rosetta,
      `/opt/homebrew` native) — worth knowing about beyond just this
      project. I didn't touch the Intel one or your shell PATH; up to you
      whether that's worth cleaning up globally.

## Known issues

- **`converse` is remote for now, not local.** `SPEC.md` § 1 leads with
  "voice never leaves the machine" — that's no longer true for the
  `converse` lane specifically, because no local model survived this
  machine's 8 GB RAM (ADR-001). `reflex` stays local (rules, no model
  needed). Revisit if a small local model ever proves out, or the machine
  changes — the router architecture (ADR-008) makes that a config change,
  not a rewrite.
- **NIM now serves both `reason` and `converse`.** The router's planned 30
  rpm bucket (`SPEC.md` § 3) was sized assuming only `reason`/`see`-fallback
  traffic. `converse` volume is much higher. Phase 3 should re-check whether
  30 rpm still holds once real usage is on it.
- Lane classification accuracy (71.1%) is below the 85% target — see
  `DECISIONS.md` ADR-001 for why it was still accepted and what would likely
  close the gap.
- This machine's `/usr/local` Homebrew is Intel/Rosetta, shadowing the
  native arm64 one at `/opt/homebrew` in PATH. `senses/ears/config.py`
  points at the native `whisper-cli` explicitly so the project is correct
  regardless, but any *other* brew-installed tool used ad hoc (not through
  this project's own config) may silently be the slower Rosetta build.
  `which -a <tool>` before trusting one's provenance.
